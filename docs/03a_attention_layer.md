# AI Task Breakdown: Attention / Engagement Layer (03a)

## Objective
The **Attention/Engagement Layer** is a specialized social feature layer designed to analyze the cognitive state and focus of the other human(s) present in the scene. Once a video passes the Social Presence Filter, this layer determines whether the external actor is actively paying attention to the POV wearer or interacting with something else.

---

## 📥 Input Requirements
This layer relies directly on the outputs of the previous filtering pipeline:
- **`filtered_manifest.json`** (required): This layer will *only* process clips that encompass genuine social interactions, safely ignoring empty rooms or isolated tasks.
- **`bystander_detections` array** (required): The per-person bounding boxes and timestamps persisted by Node 02's Social Presence Filter. This layer uses these to crop and track each bystander without re-running YOLO.
- **Cross-layer (optional)**: None. This layer has no sibling-layer dependencies.

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy

### 1. Actor Tracking & Isolation
For **each** `person_id` in the manifest's `bystander_detections` array, use the pre-computed bounding boxes as initialization for temporal face/body tracking throughout the clip. If multiple bystanders are present, each is tracked and scored independently. This ensures we capture the attention state of every visible person, not just the most prominent one.

### 2. Frame Sampling Strategy
Running inference on every frame is prohibitively expensive. Use the following tiered sampling approach:
- **Default stride**: Sample 1 frame every **0.5 seconds** (2 FPS effective). This is sufficient for head-pose estimation which changes relatively slowly.
- **Adaptive boost**: If the attention score changes by more than `0.3` between two consecutive samples, temporarily increase to **5 FPS** for the next 2 seconds to capture the transition with finer resolution.
- **Alignment**: Sampling timestamps should be snapped to the nearest frame boundary using the clip's native `fps` from the manifest to avoid inter-frame interpolation artifacts.

### 3. Gaze and Head-Pose Estimation & Target Mapping
We must determine not only if the bystander is focusing on the POV wearer's face (the camera lens) but also if they are paying attention to the *action* being performed (e.g., the POV actor's hands). 
- **SOTA 3D Gaze Raycasting (Recommended for batch)**: 
  1. Use a state-of-the-art 3D gaze estimation model (e.g., **L2CS-Net** or **CrossGaze**) to regress pitch and yaw directly from the bystander's cropped face.
  2. Project this 3D gaze vector into a 2D "ray" across the video frame.
  3. Validate the intersection of this ray against two primary targets: the camera center (POV actor's face/eyes) and the POV actor's hands (detected via an egocentric hand detector like MediaPipe Hands or an Ego4D-trained object detector).
  4. The final `attention_score` is derived from the minimum distance between the projected gaze ray and these target regions. High attention is scored if the bystander is watching *either* the camera lens *or* the task/hands.
- **VLM Approach (Recommended for validation/spot-check)**: Use local Vision Language Models (e.g., Ollama running `moondream` or `Qwen2.5-VL`) on sampled frames to perform cognitive state classification, asking specific prompts like *"Is the person in the frame looking directly at the camera or at the task being performed? Respond with a confidence score from 0 to 100."*

### 4. Attention Scoring & Temporal Trace
For each bystander, compile the per-sample attention values into a **temporal attention trace**—a timeseries of `(timestamp, score)` pairs. From this trace, derive summary statistics:
- `average_attention_score`: Mean across all samples.
- `peak_engagement_timestamp_sec`: Timestamp of the highest single-sample score.
- `attention_variance`: Variance of the trace (high variance = flickering attention).
- `sustained_engagement_sec`: Longest contiguous window where score ≥ 0.7.

The raw trace is critical for downstream layer correlation (e.g., 03b Reasonable Emotion can check if the bystander was even looking when the emotion was detected).

## 📤 Output Schema and Integration
In adherence to the Ongoing Layers Paradigm, this layer will *never* modify the original video. It will produce an isolated JSON output, keyed by the `video_id`. When multiple bystanders exist, each gets their own entry in the `per_person` array, plus the file includes an aggregated summary.

**Example Output Data (`03a_attention_result.json`):**
```json
{
  "video_id": "ego4d_clip_10293",
  "layer": "03a_attention",
  "processing_meta": {
    "model_used": "l2cs_net_3d_gaze",
    "sampling_fps_effective": 2.0
  },
  "per_person": [
    {
      "person_id": 0,
      "average_attention_score": 0.85,
      "peak_engagement_timestamp_sec": 4.2,
      "attention_variance": 0.04,
      "sustained_engagement_sec": 6.1,
      "is_engaged": true,
      "gaze_target_classification": "POV_Actor_Hands",
      "attention_trace": [
        {"t": 0.0, "score": 0.72},
        {"t": 0.5, "score": 0.81},
        {"t": 1.0, "score": 0.90},
        {"t": 1.5, "score": 0.88}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "aggregate": {
    "num_bystanders_tracked": 1,
    "mean_attention_all_persons": 0.85,
    "any_person_engaged": true
  }
}
```

This dehydrated result can then be successfully merged into the master database for later end-to-end Hugging Face Dataset packaging. The `attention_trace` timeseries is specifically designed to be consumable by sibling layers for temporal correlation.
