# AI Task Breakdown: Affirmation Gesture Layer (03e)

## Objective
The **Affirmation Gesture Layer** parses the most explicit non-verbal heuristic an infant uses for moral validation: Head Nodding and Head Shaking. Even if an adult is smiling, a shaking head signals "No." This layer extracts rhythmic, high-frequency spatial oscillations from the bystander's head tracking data to explicitly classify affirmation or negation.

---

## 📥 Input Requirements
- **`03a_attention_result.json`** (required cross-layer): This layer acts as a direct mathematical extension of 03a. We reuse the 3D Pitch/Yaw vectors extracted by L2CS-Net during the attention phase.
- **`filtered_manifest.json`**: For reaction window boundaries.

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy

### 1. Data Reuse Pipeline
Do not re-run inference on the videos. Load the raw 3D head pose arrays from Layer 03a. For each sample in the reaction window, we have `(timestamp, pitch, yaw)`.

### 2. Time-Series Signal Processing (SciPy)
Nodding and shaking have distinct frequency signatures—they are rhythmic oscillations occurring roughly between 1Hz and 3Hz.
- Use `scipy.signal` to apply a Bandpass Filter to isolate frequencies typical of human communication gestures.
- **Nodding Detection**: Look for rhythmic variance (peaks and valleys) exclusively on the **Pitch** (up/down) axis. Use peak-finding algorithms to count zero-crossings. If > 2 oscillating zero-crossings occur vertically within 1.5 seconds, flag as `nodding`.
- **Shaking Detection**: Apply the exact same logic to the **Yaw** (left/right) axis. If rhythmic oscillation breaches the variance threshold laterally, flag as `shaking`.

### 3. Emotion Corollary
Combine this with Layer 03b. A "Smile" + "Nod" = Absolute positive validation. A "Smile" + "Shake" = Playful invalidation or disbelief.

## 📤 Output Schema and Integration
**Example Output Data (`03e_affirmation_gesture_result.json`):**
```json
{
  "video_id": "ego4d_clip_10293",
  "layer": "03e_affirmation_gesture",
  "tasks_analyzed": [
    {
      "task_id": "t_01",
      "per_person": [
        {
          "person_id": 0,
          "pitch_variance_hz": 2.1,
          "yaw_variance_hz": 0.2,
          "gesture_detected": "affirming_nod",
          "confidence": 0.94
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Verification & Validation Check
- **Singular Video Test**: Plot the Pitch and Yaw arrays explicitly on a matplotlib line graph for a known head-nod video. Visually identify the sine-wave signature of the nod on the Pitch axis and verify the SciPy peak-finding logic successfully counted the nodes.
- **Batch Test**: Pass 50 clips through the signal processor. Assert that the script executes in milliseconds (as it uses pre-computed vectors) and gracefully handles `NaN` values where L2CS-Net lost tracking on the face, filling defaults safely to avoid breaking the Pandas merge step on the **Mac mini M4 Pro**.
